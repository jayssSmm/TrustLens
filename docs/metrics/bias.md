# Bias and Fairness Metrics

Bias and fairness metrics expose subgroup disparities so teams can evaluate equity risk before release.

## Why This Matters

A model can look strong in aggregate while underperforming for specific groups.
Fairness diagnostics make those gaps visible and actionable.

## When to Use

- when model decisions affect people across demographic or policy-sensitive segments
- when governance requires subgroup performance reporting
- when release policy includes fairness checks

## Inputs and Assumptions

- `y_true`: ground-truth labels
- `y_pred`: predicted labels
- `sensitive_features`: dictionary of aligned subgroup arrays
- equalized-odds analysis assumes binary target labels

## Output and Interpretation

Key outputs include:

- **Class imbalance report**: class distribution risk context
- **Subgroup performance**: per-group metrics and gap summaries
- **Equalized odds summary**: TPR/FPR disparity severity across groups

Large subgroup gaps or severe equalized-odds violations should be treated as release blockers in high-impact domains.

## Visualization

TrustLens provides built-in visualization tools to help interpret fairness diagnostics:

- **Subgroup Performance Plot**: Visualizes metric gaps (e.g., accuracy, F1) across groups.
- **Equalized Odds Plot**: Side-by-side TPR/FPR comparison to identify specific disparity types.
- **Fairness Gap Plot**: Summarizes the maximum TPR and FPR gaps between groups.

These can be accessed directly via `report.plot_bias()` or through the specialized plotting functions in `trustlens.visualization.fairness`.

## Limitations and Caveats

- fairness metrics are sensitive to subgroup sample size
- skipped equalized-odds checks are input constraints, not fairness clearance
- outputs are statistical diagnostics, not causal proof
