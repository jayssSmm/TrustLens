# System Architecture

TrustLens is designed as a layered pipeline so diagnostic computation, scoring logic, and report interpretation remain decoupled and maintainable.

## Why This Design Matters

The architecture aims to solve three practical needs:

- stable and testable metric computation
- explicit decision logic with traceable rules
- clear extension points for contributors

## High-Level Data Flow

This diagram shows how inputs move from orchestration through framework-specific resolvers to the agnostic metrics pipeline.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[Input: model, X, y_true, y_prob?, sensitive_features?] --> API[api.analyze Orchestration]
    API --> Registry[Backend Registry]

    subgraph "Prediction Resolution Layer"
        Registry --> Detect[Framework Detection]
        Detect --> Resolver[Framework Resolver: Sklearn/XGBoost]
        Resolver --> Bundle[PredictionBundle: y_pred, y_prob, metadata]
    end

    Bundle --> Pipeline[Core Pipeline: Agnostic]

    subgraph "Agnostic Metrics Engine"
        Pipeline --> Calib[Calibration: Brier, ECE]
        Pipeline --> Fail[Failure: Confidence Gap]
        Pipeline --> Bias[Bias: Subgroup, Equalized Odds]
        Pipeline --> Rep[Representation: Silhouette]
    end

    Calib --> Results[Results Dict]
    Fail --> Results
    Bias --> Results
    Rep --> Results

    Results --> Scoring["trust_score.py: base_score vs Penalties"]
    Scoring --> Report[TrustReport: Narrative & Interpretation]
    Report --> Output[Console / Plots / Saved Files]
```

**Implementation note**: `analyze()` uses the `Backend Registry` to automatically detect the framework and resolve predictions into a standardized `PredictionBundle`. This ensures the core metrics pipeline remains 100% framework-agnostic.

## Component Interactions

The system is decoupled into four primary layers.

```mermaid
graph LR
    API["api.py: Orchestration"] -- "model" --> Backends["backends/: Framework Resolvers"]
    Backends -- "PredictionBundle" --> Pipeline["core/pipeline.py: Execution Engine"]
    Pipeline -- "dict: results" --> Report["report.py: TrustReport"]
    Report -- "dict: results" --> Score["trust_score.py: Scoring Engine"]
    Score -- "TrustScoreResult" --> Report
```

### Data Contracts

1. **API to Backends**: Model reference, feature matrix `X`, and optional manual overrides (`y_pred`, `y_prob`).
2. **Backends to Pipeline**: `PredictionBundle` containing standardized numpy arrays, framework identifier, and audit metadata.
3. **Pipeline to Metrics**: Normalized arrays (`y_true`, `y_pred`, `y_prob`) and optional metadata.
4. **Pipeline to Report**: Consolidated `results` plus audit provenance (framework version, resolver details).
5. **Report to Scorer**: Score computation from `results` including penalties and blockers.

## Execution Sequence

This sequence shows one `analyze()` call from input to `TrustReport`.

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant API as api.analyze
    participant Registry as Backend Registry
    participant Backend as backends/
    participant Pipeline as core.pipeline
    participant Report as TrustReport

    User->>API: model, X, y_true
    API->>Registry: get_resolver(model)
    Registry-->>API: Resolver function
    API->>Backend: resolve(model, X)
    Backend-->>API: PredictionBundle
    API->>Pipeline: _run_analysis_pipeline(Bundle)
    Pipeline->>Pipeline: Dispatch Agnostic Modules
    Pipeline->>Report: Initialize(results, Bundle.metadata)
    Report-->>User: TrustReport Object
```

## Layer Responsibilities

### Orchestration Layer (`api.py`)

- Coordinates framework detection and prediction resolution.
- Validates high-level input shapes and data consistency.
- Delegates to the framework-agnostic core pipeline.

### Framework Resolvers (`backends/`)

- Handles framework-specific prediction logic (e.g., `predict_proba`).
- Normalizes output shapes (e.g., binary `(n,)` → `(n, 2)`).
- Captures audit metadata (framework version, model type).
- Blocks unsupported tasks (e.g., regression or ranking).

### Core Pipeline (`trustlens/core/pipeline.py`)

- **Framework-agnostic** execution engine.
- Dispatches enabled metrics modules.
- Manages progress tracking and resource isolation.

### Metrics Layer (`trustlens/metrics/`)

- Pure math/stat functions for diagnostics.
- Independent of models; operates entirely on labels and probabilities.

### Reporting Layer (`trustlens/report.py`)

- Packages diagnostic outputs with full backend provenance.
- Generates textual and visual summaries.
- Supports unified JSON serialization for experiment trackers.

### Comparison Layer (`comparison.py`)

- compares candidate `TrustReport` objects
- filters blocked candidates
- provides deployment recommendation rationale

## Extensibility Path

To add a new metric module:

1. implement the metric under `trustlens/metrics/`
2. wire dispatch logic in `analyze()`
3. ensure return format follows existing `results` conventions
4. add tests and documentation
5. optionally integrate into trust score weighting

## Architectural Constraints

- optimized for classification evaluation
- fairness checks are data- and task-dependent
- representation diagnostics require embeddings
- some threshold logic is currently heuristic by design
