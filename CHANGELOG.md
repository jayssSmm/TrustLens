## [v0.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Major Architectural Milestone: Framework-Agnostic Core
This release marks the transition of TrustLens from a scikit-learn-specific library to a framework-agnostic trustworthiness platform.

### Added
- **Prediction Resolver Architecture**: A new plugin-based backend system for resolving predictions across different ML frameworks.
- **XGBoost Support**: Native support for `XGBClassifier` and raw `Booster` objects (including DMatrix conversion and objective-based task blocking).
- **Manual Override Mode**: Full support for `model=None` workflows where users provide `y_pred` and `y_prob` manually.
- **Degraded Mode Transparency**: Explicit metadata tracking for missing components (`degraded_mode`, `missing_components`) when probabilistic data is unavailable.
- **Hardened Prediction Contract**: Strict validation for non-finite values (NaN/Inf) and probability range enforcement with EPS tolerance.
- **Unified JSON Artifact Export**: `TrustReport.save("report.json")` now produces a single, self-contained JSON artifact containing results, metadata, and trust scores.

### Improved
- **Architectural Decoupling**: Fully refactored `trustlens/api.py` and `trustlens/core/pipeline.py` to be framework-agnostic.
- **Lazy Loading**: Framework-specific dependencies (like XGBoost) are now loaded lazily, ensuring a minimal footprint for scikit-learn users.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Added Python 3.13 support, security auditing (`pip-audit`), and automated build validation.
- **Documentation**: Fully synchronized Sphinx documentation, including new internal RFCs for backend developers.

### Fixed
- **Multiclass Brier Score**: Fixed a core metric bug where calibration analysis assumed binary probabilities for all models. TrustLens now correctly computes the Multiclass Brier Score (Mean Squared Error across all classes) for N-class problems.
- Fixed numerical instability in calibration metrics via automatic probability clipping.
- Improved classifier detection to support custom mock objects and non-BaseEstimator wrappers.
- Fixed Sphinx build warnings related to non-consecutive header levels and broken links.
- Corrected relative links in `docs/index.md` and `docs/EXPERIMENTAL.md`.
- Fixed CI failures by updating mypy configuration for Python 3.9 EOL compliance.
- Resolved type-shadowing and incompatible assignment errors in `GradCAM`.
- Hardened prediction resolver registry with explicit type hints and improved error handling.
- Fully propagated `Optional[y_prob]` support through the core pipeline, plugin architecture, and visualization dashboard, ensuring robust handling of non-probabilistic models.

### Compatibility / Migration
- **No breaking changes** for existing scikit-learn users.
- `analyze()` remains backward compatible; existing workflows will continue to work unchanged while benefiting from improved internal validation.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added
- 2D embedding visualization (`plot_embedding_2d`) with automatic UMAP → t-SNE → PCA fallback, class-colored scatter plot, silhouette score annotation, and configurable subsampling (`n_max`). Integrated into `report.plot()` auto-dispatch. Thanks @WeiGuang-2099
- `embedding_separability` metric computing silhouette score, within/between-class distances, and separability ratio. Thanks @WeiGuang-2099
- 14 tests covering representation metrics, CKA, and 2D embedding visualization. Thanks @WeiGuang-2099
- Model comparison API (`trustlens.compare`) for head-to-head multi-model evaluation and recommendation.
- Pattern detection system (e.g., "Calibration Drift", "Confidently Wrong") to surface high-level semantic risks.
- Initial `equalized_odds()` fairness metric with per-group TPR/FPR analysis (closes #17). Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Ranked score explanation layer to justify Trust Score deductions.
- `equalized_odds()`: added input validation, configurable violation thresholds (`severe_threshold`, `moderate_threshold`), and concrete docstring examples (closes #41) Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Fairness visualization module (`trustlens/visualization/fairness.py`) with `plot_subgroup_performance()`, `plot_equalized_odds()`, and `plot_fairness_gap()` (closes #52) Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Upgraded `TrustReport.plot_bias()` with multi-mode diagnostic support:
  - New `mode` parameter: `"summary"` (default), `"all"`, `"subgroup"`, `"equalized_odds"`, and `"gap"`.
  - Added deterministic return contracts (Returns `Figure` or `dict[str, Figure | None]`).
  - Implemented backend-safe `plt.show()` and automated `save_path` suffixing for batch plotting.
  - Hardened validation for bias data structures and added memory hygiene documentation.
- Added bias analysis demo with subgroup diagnostics (`examples/bias_analysis_demo.py`). Thanks @sidharth-vijayan
- Added SECURITY.md. Thanks @MustansirNisar
- Added unit tests for multi-feature fairness visualizations covering all-features-processed guarantee, output key matching, and figure smoke tests (`tests/test_fairness_visualization_multi.py`). Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- `_plot_multi_helper()` — internal helper that eliminates duplication across `*_multi` wrappers and enforces deterministic (sorted) feature iteration.
- `_safe_name()` — filename sanitizer for feature names containing spaces or special characters (e.g., `"income level"` → `income_level`).
- `_BIAS_PLOT_TYPES` — internal registry for deterministic plot-type dispatch ordering in `_plot_bias()`.
- `tests/conftest.py` — centralized Agg backend configuration for the test suite.
- `tests/test_plot_module_multi_feature.py` — 23 integration tests covering nested figure outputs, filename sanitization, orchestrated saving, and edge cases.
- `TrustReport.plot_bias()` now accepts an opt-in `multi_feature: bool = False` parameter for per-feature visualization output. With `multi_feature=True`, single modes (`"subgroup"`, `"equalized_odds"`, `"gap"`) return `dict[str, Figure]` keyed by feature name, and `mode="all"` returns a nested `dict[str, dict[str, Figure]]` keyed by mode then feature. The structure is fixed by the `(mode, multi_feature)` combination, missing components are represented by empty dicts (never `None`), and feature ordering is deterministic (`sorted(feature_names)`). Default behavior (`multi_feature=False`) is unchanged. `tests/test_plot_bias_multi_feature.py` adds 18 tests covering the four return-shape cells, partial-data handling, deterministic ordering, and invalid-mode interaction (closes #74). Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui

### Improved
- Final Trust Score logic now includes a base score, penalty breakdown, and decisive deployment verdicts.
- Standardized canonical terminology to "confidence-weighted errors".
- Enhanced failure diagnostics with confidence concentration insights (range analysis).
- Bias reporting now includes explicit margin calculations relative to the 0.10 threshold.
- Comparison engine includes causal reasoning (e.g., linking selection to lower penalty burdens).
- Integrated fairness metrics into the main `analyze()` pipeline with safe fallback handling and margin reporting.
- Unified validation error message format in `equalized_odds()` for consistency. Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Enhanced `_violation_level()` docstring with parameter descriptions and threshold details. Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Fairness visualization now supports multiple sensitive features via `plot_subgroup_performance_multi()`, `plot_equalized_odds_multi()`, and `plot_fairness_gap_multi()`, which return per-feature figures as `{feature_name: Figure}`. Fixed `_plot_bias()` to no longer silently drop features after the first (closes #56). Thanks @komoike-oss28-ui
- Enhanced bias module usability with visual diagnostics for easier interpretation.
- Refactored `_plot_bias()` into a pure figure-generation function (no file I/O or side effects). All saving and figure closing is now centralized in `plot_module()`.
- `plot_module()` now handles nested `dict[str, dict[str, Figure]]` outputs for multi-feature bias data, with standardized filenames (`bias_<type>_<feature>.png`).
- Updated `docs/metrics/bias.md`, `docs/features.md`, and `README.md` with multi-feature visualization documentation, usage examples, and file output reference.

### Fixed
- Removed all `matplotlib.use("Agg")` calls from library modules (6 visualization files, `report.py`, `gradcam.py`). This was silently overriding the user's matplotlib backend at import time, breaking interactive use in Jupyter and GUI environments.

### Stability
- Maintained full backward compatibility with the `analyze()` API.
- All 219 tests passing.

- Updated README architecture tree to distinguish stable vs experimental modules.
- Replaced misleading `pyproject.toml` keyword `"explainability"` with `"model trust"`.
- Renamed `examples/cnn_vs_vit_trustlens.py` → `examples/model_comparison.py` to match actual content (sklearn models, not deep learning).
- Added actionable Pipeline Module Registry guard in `api.py` to prevent accidental re-exposure of experimental code.

### Fixed
- Prevented crashes in `describe_array` for empty inputs.
- Corrected bin count computation in `reliability_curve()` to use exact binning logic. Thanks @WeiGuang-2099
